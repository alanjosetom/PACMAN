### You can download the file and run it. But before running the code, you should install the following Packages.

### To install the required packages, you can use the following pip commands:


!pip install gymnasium

!pip install "gymnasium[atari, accept-rom-license]"

!apt-get install -y swig

!pip install gymnasium[box2d]

!pip install ale-py

!pip install shimmy[atari]

!pip install gymnasium[atari, accept-rom-license]

!pip install autorom[accept-rom-license]


### More than these packages install other header files like:


pip install -r requirements.txt

## Note:
### - The modules `os`, `io`, `glob`, `random`, and `collections.deque` are part of the Python Standard Library and do not require installation.
### - `base64` is also part of the Python Standard Library.
